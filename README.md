# Mateusz Stawski Test Task

Nuxt application: Vue, Vuetify, Typescript, Sass, Pinia

I had an opportunity to work with PrimeVue and Tailwind in some of the projects, however as the goal was to show my best side of me, I have used the technologies I'm best at which is Vuetify and Sass. 

There is eslint added to keep best practises. 

I'm willing to solve another task if it is required to show my skills in broader way.

I'm aware that the styling is worth improving, however I'm not an UX designer, anyway I tried my best to make it look good :)

UI supports mobile devices view.
